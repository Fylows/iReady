### üí° About iReady

**iReady** is a web-based application designed to assist Local Government Units (LGUs) in enhancing their recovery and response efforts during times of calamities.

By integrating pre-storm relief planning and logistics optimization, iReady aims to improve community resilience and ensure that aid and resources are allocated efficiently and effectively before disasters strike.

### üß≠ Project Goals

- Strengthen preparedness through data-driven planning
- Optimize logistics and resource distribution
- Support LGUs with real-time, accessible dashboards
- Improve resilience and coordination before and after storms

### üß© Tech Stack

This project is a full-stack web application with a Python-based modelling component. The tech stack includes:

- Frontend
  - React 18 (via Vite)
  - TypeScript
  - TailwindCSS (with plugins like `@tailwindcss/typography`)
  - React ecosystem: `react-dom`, `@tanstack/react-query` (react-query), `react-hook-form`, `react-leaflet`, `recharts`, `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `react-icons`
  - Radix UI primitives (several `@radix-ui/*` packages)
  - `wouter` for client routing

- Backend
  - Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
  - Vite used as dev server and build pipeline for the client
  - `esbuild` for bundling the server during production builds
  - Session and auth: `express-session`, `passport`, `passport-local`, `connect-pg-simple`, `memorystore`
  - Drizzle ORM and `drizzle-kit` for database migrations/schema

- Data & Model
  - Python 3 scripts for Random Forest model (pandas, numpy; scikit-learn implied)
